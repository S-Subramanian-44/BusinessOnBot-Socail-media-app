# Problem Statement
Develop a social media application that allows users to create accounts, log in, and share posts publicly. While Node.js is the preferred backend technology, any frameworks or libraries you are comfortable with can be used. Similarly, Angular is the preferred choice for the frontend, but you can use any frameworks or libraries that suit your preferences. Key features should include user authentication, profile management, post creation, search users and a responsive design optimized for various devices. All users, posts, and profile information needs to be stored in a database, whether it's SQL or NoSQL. To make it accessible to users, both frontend and backend components need to be deployed.

This system should offer the following functionalities:

## User Registration and Authentication:

- Users should be able to securely register for an account and log in using their username and password

- Google Oauth can be added if possible

## View and Add posts:

- Users should be able to view all public posts.

- Users can add posts from their account and it should be visible to all users.

## View and update profile:

- Users should be able to edit or update the profile section.

## Search users:

- Users should have the capability to perform searches using alternative usernames.

## User Experience:

- Design an intuitive and responsive user interface for desktop.
- Ensure the user interface is easy to navigate and visually appealing.

## Deployment:

- Deploy both frontend and backend application to a suitable hosting service.

- Provide the hosted URLs for both the frontend and backend components.

- Provide a screen record of our entire working application (public URL)

- Any hosting services can be used, including some free hosting services such as - Heroku  Netlify  Glitch

- Add the entire source code with a proper README.md to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and provide public access to the repository..
