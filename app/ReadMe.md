# Social Media Flask App

This Flask-based social media application allows users to register, log in, create posts with multimedia content (images and videos), like posts, update their profile photo, and view posts from all users. The application integrates with MySQL for user authentication, storing posts, and managing likes.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register with unique usernames and passwords, and then log in securely to access the platform's features.
  
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile photos, view their own posts, and see the posts they've liked.
  
- **Post Creation and Viewing**: Users can create posts with text content and optionally attach multimedia files such as images or videos. All users can view posts from other users on a centralized feed.
